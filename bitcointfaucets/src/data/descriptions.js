      "Making money from bitcoin faucets is the easiest method for acquiring a small amount of bitcoin. You get a small part of bitcoin called satoshi every 20-60 minutes, in order to claim you have to solve the CAPTCHA. The amount earned per faucet is low, but if you combine them all together it adds up, if you claim on all the websites listed here you will earn around $1 in satoshi. You can increase your earnings by referring other people and doing offers. Some of the faucets have loyalty programs which increase your earnings over time.",
